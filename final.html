        <h1>Dove® Real Beauty </h1>
        <p>Looking down at yourself, you realize that you will never have what it “takes” to be like the women you see all the time in the media. You get so depressed and obsessed with achieving the perfect body image that you go to extreme extents as a result. This is happening to thousands of girls each day.

Online, on television, in magazines and pretty much anywhere you look, young women who are shown through the media all have “perfect” bodies and gorgeous faces to match. The display of these particular women who often struggle themselves to get their bodies this way, is the cause of young girls feeling negatively about their bodies and being pressured to have identical bodies to these women. </p>

        <h2>The Pressure for Girls to Be Perfect in Today’s Society</h2>
        <p>Dove reached out to every different body type, skin color, hair color, and everything else that makes people unique. They showed skinny women, women with beauty marks, women with short hair, and other varieties. This campaign was extremely successful and it gave young girls, as well as women, the confidence they need.

Some people are born very thin and they become models, and that’s okay. Some people, however, are not born with “model bodies.” It is these people, who try too hard to achieve this “dream body” that do the most damage to themselves.

Looking at the same type of bodies over and over agin might convince you to act out and harm your body. The wise words “it’s on the inside that counts” that you’ve heard and devoured and soon forgotten, are replaced by the constant fear of not being good enough.</p>
